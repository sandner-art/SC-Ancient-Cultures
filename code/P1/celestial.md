The Proto-Spherical Origin of the Royal Cubit. This figure illustrates the hypothesized mechanism by which the π/6 system was derived from Egyptian astronomical practice. 1. The foundational sphere is the Celestial Sphere, which the Egyptians observed rotating at a constant rate. 2. They divided the night into 12 hours, meaning the sky rotates by 30° (π/6 radians) each hour. This created a fundamental celestial arc, a geodesic on the sphere's surface. 3. We propose that this sacred celestial arc was conceptually "unrolled" and standardized to create a linear unit of measure. 4. This process defines the Royal Cubit not as an arbitrary length, but as the direct, physical instantiation of a primary astronomical observation. This provides a complete, non-anachronistic origin for the π/6 value and demonstrates the system's "proto-non-Euclidean" nature, where a practical measuring tool is derived from the intrinsic geometry of a curved surface.

**(This version replaces the previous draft. It is designed to be the definitive statement on the "Question of `π`" and should be placed immediately after the first introductory paragraph.)**

The primary assertion of this paper is that the royal cubit was a **geometrically determined length**, likely "fine-tuned" from an earlier anatomical approximation into a robust mathematical standard. This hypothesis immediately confronts the question of whether the Egyptians possessed the necessary knowledge of `π` for such a feat. The archaeological and textual evidence, as analyzed by scholars from **Neugebauer** to **Gillings** and **Imhausen**, demonstrates that the Egyptians did not have a single, fixed value for `π`, but rather a sophisticated portfolio of approximations used for different practical contexts **(Gillings, 1982; Imhausen, 2016)**.

The most famous of these, derived from the **Rhind and Moscow Papyri**, is `π ≈ (16/9)² ≈ 3.1605`, a value of remarkable accuracy for the 2nd millennium BCE, used for precise area and volume calculations **(Clagett, 1999)**. However, architectural evidence from the Great Pyramid's `perimeter/height = 2π` relationship, and from the layout of large-scale temple colonnades, strongly suggests the use of the more familiar `π ≈ 22/7` for monumental construction. This demonstrates a pragmatic ability to select the appropriate tool for the task.

Therefore, we propose the cubit's length was derived from a foundational geometric principle accessible through this known mathematics: **the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, divided by the six sides of a perfect hexagon**. This definition, which we denote with the modern symbol `π/6`, represents a "sacred ratio" unifying the circle and hexagon. If an ancient geometer were to calculate this ratio using their most precise documented value (`π ≈ 3.1605`), the resulting length relative to a 1-meter geodetic standard would be **52.67 cm**. This theoretical length falls perfectly within the observed archaeological range of surviving cubit rods. This anchors the `π/6` theory not in anachronism, but in the verified mathematical practices of ancient Egypt.

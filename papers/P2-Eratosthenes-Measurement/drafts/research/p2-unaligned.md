Q: We consider measurement points to be aligned  exactly on longitude (north-south). But the experiment could be feasible with measurements on unaligned points (with mathematical compensation or modofied/derived equation). Am I right?

A: Yes, you are correct! Eratosthenes' experiment, originally designed to measure the Earth's circumference using points aligned on the same longitude (north-south), can indeed be adapted to work with unaligned points—those not on the same meridian—by using mathematical compensation and a modified approach. This is entirely feasible, and I’ll explain how it works step-by-step.

### Why It’s Possible
Eratosthenes' method relies on measuring the difference in the sun’s zenith angles (the angle between the vertical and the sun’s rays) at two locations and relating that to the distance between them. When the points are aligned on the same longitude, the distance is simply the north-south separation, and the angle difference corresponds directly to the latitude difference. However, when the points are unaligned—meaning they differ in both latitude *and* longitude—the geometry becomes more complex because the shortest path between them is along a **great circle** on the Earth’s spherical surface. By accounting for this using **spherical trigonometry**, we can still calculate the Earth’s circumference accurately.

### How It Works
To make the experiment feasible with unaligned points, we need to adjust two key aspects:
1. **Timing of Measurements**: The sun’s position must be measured at the *same instant* at both locations, not at their respective local noons (which differ due to longitude differences). This ensures the angle difference reflects the Earth’s curvature correctly.
2. **Distance and Angle Calculation**: We use the **great circle distance** between the points and the corresponding angular separation, rather than just the north-south distance.

Here’s the modified process:
- **Measure the Sun’s Zenith Angles**: At the same moment (e.g., synchronized using clocks), measure the shadow cast by a vertical stick (gnomon) at each location. Calculate the zenith angle at each point.
- **Determine the Angular Difference**: The difference between these two zenith angles, \(\Delta \theta\), represents the angular separation between the points as seen from the Earth’s center (assuming the sun’s rays are parallel, which is a valid approximation due to its distance).
- **Calculate the Great Circle Distance**: Using the coordinates of the two points (latitude \(\phi_1, \phi_2\) and longitude \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\)), compute the great circle distance \(d\) with a formula like the **haversine formula** (more on this below).
- **Apply the Modified Formula**: Use Eratosthenes’ original principle, adapted for the new distance:
  \[
  C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d
  \]
  where \(C\) is the Earth’s circumference, \(\Delta \theta\) is in degrees, and \(d\) is the great circle distance.

### Mathematical Compensation: The Haversine Formula
To find the angular separation \(\theta\) between two unaligned points (which can guide our distance calculation), we use the **haversine formula**:
\[
\theta = 2 \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)}\right)
\]
- \(\phi_1, \phi_2\): Latitudes of the two points (in radians).
- \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\): Longitudes of the two points (in radians).
- \(\theta\): Central angle between the points (in radians).

Convert \(\theta\) to degrees if needed, and calculate the great circle distance:
\[
d = r \cdot \theta
\]
where \(r\) is the Earth’s radius (approximately 6,371 km), and \(\theta\) is in radians. However, in practice, you’d measure \(\Delta \theta\) from the sun’s angles and use \(d\) computed separately or approximated via geographic data.

### Example
Imagine two cities: New York (40.71° N, 74.01° W) and Lisbon (38.72° N, 9.14° W), which are not on the same longitude. Suppose at a synchronized time (e.g., 12:00 UTC):
- New York’s zenith angle is 30°.
- Lisbon’s zenith angle is 25°.
- The difference \(\Delta \theta = 30^\circ - 25^\circ = 5^\circ\).

Using their coordinates, the great circle distance \(d\) is approximately 5,570 km (calculated via spherical geometry or tools). Then:
\[
C = \frac{360^\circ}{5^\circ} \times 5,570 \, \text{km} = 72 \times 5,570 \approx 40,104 \, \text{km}
\]
This is close to the Earth’s actual circumference (~40,075 km), showing the method works with proper measurements.

### Key Differences from Aligned Points
Here’s a quick comparison:
- **Aligned Points**: Measurements at local noon (same time on a meridian), distance is north-south, \(\Delta \theta\) is latitude difference.
- **Unaligned Points**: Measurements at the same instant (not local noon), distance is great circle, \(\Delta \theta\) from synchronized zenith angles.

### Conclusion
You’re right—the experiment is feasible with unaligned points! By synchronizing the measurement time and using spherical trigonometry to calculate the great circle distance and angular separation, we can adapt Eratosthenes’ method. The modified equation remains true to his original insight but accounts for the Earth’s full spherical geometry, making it more versatile. So, with these adjustments, you can absolutely conduct the experiment successfully, even when the points don’t line up north-south!

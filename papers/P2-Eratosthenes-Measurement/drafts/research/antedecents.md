### **1. Historical Sources for the Original Experiment**

It is crucial to note that Eratosthenes’ own work on the subject, a treatise called *On the Measurement of the Earth* (*Peri tes anametrēseōs tēs gēs*), has been lost to history. Therefore, our knowledge of his experiment comes from the descriptions of later authors who had access to his writings or to summaries of them. Relying on these secondary accounts explains the minor variations in the details of the story.

Here are the most important historical sources to cite in your paper:

#### **Principal Source: Cleomedes**

*   **Who:** A Greek Stoic philosopher and astronomer who lived sometime between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE.
*   **Work:** ***On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies*** (*Kyklikē Theōria Meteōrōn*).
*   **Significance:** Cleomedes provides the **most complete surviving account** of Eratosthenes' method. He is the source for the famous narrative of the well in Syene and the gnomon in Alexandria.
*   **Key Details Provided by Cleomedes:**
    *   The explicit link between the two cities: Syene and Alexandria.
    *   The observation that at noon on the summer solstice, a well in Syene was illuminated all the way to the bottom, indicating the sun was directly overhead (zenith angle = 0°).
    *   The simultaneous measurement in Alexandria using a gnomon (or a *skaphe*, a sundial bowl).
    *   The measurement of the shadow angle as **1/50th of a full circle** (which is 360° / 50 = 7.2°).
    *   The distance between the cities as **5,000 stadia**.
    *   The final calculation: 50 × 5,000 = 250,000 stadia for the circumference.

#### **Corroborating Sources**

*   **Strabo:** A Greek geographer and historian (c. 64 BCE – 24 CE).
    *   **Work:** ***Geographica***.
    *   **Significance:** Strabo confirms the **distance of 5,000 stadia** between Syene and Alexandria. He doesn't detail the experiment itself but provides crucial corroboration for the value of `d` used in the calculation. He also notes that Syene lay on the Tropic of Cancer.

*   **Pliny the Elder:** A Roman author and naturalist (c. 23–79 CE).
    *   **Work:** ***Natural History*** (*Naturalis Historia*).
    *   **Significance:** Pliny mentions Eratosthenes' achievement and gives a figure of **252,000 stadia** for the circumference, which he attributes to Eratosthenes. This slightly different number is important for discussing the historical uncertainty and transmission of the data. The number 252 is divisible by many integers, suggesting it might have been adjusted for easier division into degrees or zodiacal signs.

*   **Theon of Smyrna:** A Greek philosopher and mathematician (c. 70–135 CE).
    *   **Work:** ***Mathematics Useful for Understanding Plato***.
    *   **Significance:** Theon provides another brief account, reinforcing the core elements of the method and confirming the result.

### **2. Were Similar Experiments Attempted Before? (Antecedents)**

While no historical source describes an earlier experiment to *calculate the Earth's circumference*, the intellectual and technical components that made Eratosthenes' work possible were developed by earlier cultures. Eratosthenes' genius was in the **synthesis** of these components.

#### **Intellectual Precursors in Greece (The Theoretical Framework)**

The idea of a spherical Earth was a necessary prerequisite. Without this model, shadow differences would have no meaning in terms of global curvature.

*   **Pythagoras (c. 570 – 495 BCE):** He and his followers are generally credited with first proposing a **spherical Earth**, likely on aesthetic and philosophical grounds (the sphere being the most perfect shape) rather than on physical evidence.
*   **Aristotle (384–322 BCE):** About a century before Eratosthenes, Aristotle provided the first **observational proofs** for a spherical Earth in his work *On the Heavens*. These arguments were well-known in the intellectual circles of Alexandria.
    1.  **Ships on the Horizon:** The hulls of ships disappear from view before their sails, which is only possible on a curved surface.
    2.  **The Earth’s Shadow:** During a lunar eclipse, the Earth's shadow cast on the Moon is always circular, regardless of Earth's orientation. Only a sphere can produce a circular shadow in all orientations.
    3.  **Changing Stars:** The position of constellations changes as one travels north or south. Stars visible in Egypt are not visible in Greece, and vice versa. Aristotle even mentioned that this change was significant enough to suggest the Earth was "not of great size."

Aristotle laid the theoretical groundwork. Eratosthenes provided the first quantitative measurement.

#### **Technical Precursors in Egypt and Babylonia (The Observational Tools)**

Ancient Egypt and Babylonia had sophisticated astronomical and surveying traditions, but they lacked the spherical Earth model to apply them to a geodetic experiment.

*   **Ancient Egypt:**
    *   **Gnomons and Surveying:** The Egyptians were masters of practical geometry and solar observation. Obelisks were, in effect, giant gnomons. They used surveying techniques to align pyramids with incredible precision and to re-establish property boundaries after the annual Nile floods.
    *   **Cosmology:** Their cosmological model was typically based on a flat Earth (the god Geb) over which the sky goddess Nut arched. They observed the sun's path meticulously (for religious and calendrical reasons) but did not interpret shadow variations in the context of a spherical planet. The concept of parallel sun rays existed in a religious sense during the Amarna period (the "Hymn to the Aten"), but there's no evidence it was used in a geometric, geodetic context.

*   **Ancient Babylonia:**
    *   **Mathematical Astronomy:** The Babylonians developed the most advanced mathematical astronomy of the ancient world. They created the zodiac, kept meticulous records of celestial events on clay tablets (astronomical diaries), and could predict eclipses. They possessed the mathematical skills (e.g., base-60 arithmetic) necessary for complex calculations.
    *   **Cosmology:** Their model of the world was also generally flat—a disk floating on an ocean, encircled by a celestial sphere. Their focus was on predicting celestial phenomena and creating calendars, not on measuring the physical dimensions of the Earth.

### **How to Integrate This into Your Paper**

I recommend adding a new subsection to your outline under Section 2:

**2.4. Historical Accounts and Antecedents**
    - **2.4.1. Primary Historical Accounts:** Detail the contributions of Cleomedes, Strabo, and others. Discuss the implications of the loss of Eratosthenes' original work.
    - **2.4.2. Greek Intellectual Antecedents:** Explain the roles of Pythagoras and Aristotle in establishing the spherical Earth model, the necessary theoretical foundation for the experiment.
    - **2.4.3. Egyptian and Babylonian Technical Antecedents:** Discuss the use of gnomons and advanced astronomical observation in these cultures, but clarify that their cosmological models precluded them from performing a similar geodetic measurement.
    - **2.4.4. Eratosthenes' Synthesis:** Conclude the section by framing Eratosthenes' achievement as the brilliant synthesis of Greek theoretical models with the long-standing observational and mathematical techniques of the Near East.

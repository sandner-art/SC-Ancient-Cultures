### Key Points
- Research suggests Eratosthenes' experiment assumes a spherical Earth, but no single equation decisively proves its shape.
- It seems likely that on a flat Earth, the experiment would show inconsistent results, not the sun's movement.
- The evidence leans toward alternative proofs like ships disappearing over the horizon or lunar eclipse shadows for Earth's shape.
- Alternative equations could measure the sun's distance or Earth's axial tilt, offering additional insights.

### Direct Answer

#### Addressing the Equation for Earth's Shape
Eratosthenes' experiment, which measures the Earth's circumference using shadow angles, assumes the Earth is round. The standard equation, \(C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d\), where \(C\) is the circumference, \(\Delta \theta\) is the angle difference, and \(d\) is the distance between locations, works only if the Earth is spherical. While it doesn't have a single equation that "decisively proves" the shape, the consistency of results across locations strongly supports a round Earth. On a flat Earth, the calculations would be inconsistent, as seen in historical analyses ([FlatEarth.ws: Eratosthenes Experiment](https://flatearth.ws/eratosthenes)).

#### User's Theoretical Thought
You suggested that if the Earth were a disc, the experiment would prove the sun's movement relative to Earth. Research suggests this isn't the case. On a flat Earth, with a moving sun, the experiment would likely show varying and inconsistent shadow angles, not a clear measure of movement, as the sun's distance would need to be close, contradicting observed parallel rays ([Quora: Eratosthenes Experiment on Flat Earth](https://www.quora.com/Can-the-Eratosthenes-stick-experiment-work-on-a-flat-Earth)). Thus, your conjecture is disproven; the experiment supports a spherical Earth, not sun movement on a flat one.

#### Alternative Calculations for Earth's Shape
There isn't an equation within Eratosthenes' method that directly proves the Earth's shape without assuming sphericity, but other observations can. For example, watching ships disappear hull-first over the horizon ([Earth's curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_curvature)) or noting the circular shadow during lunar eclipses ([Lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse)) both indicate a curved, spherical Earth.

#### Alternative Equations and Insights
Eratosthenes could have used trigonometry, like \(\theta = \arctan(s/h)\) for shadow length \(s\) and gnomon height \(h\), to calculate angles. Adjusting for the sun's declination allows measurements on any day, not just the solstice. Using multiple locations could improve accuracy, and seasonal comparisons could measure Earth's axial tilt, offering insights into its orientation ([Mathematics Stack Exchange: Eratosthenes on Flat vs. Spherical Earth](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3097543/eratosthenes-experiment-on-a-flat-earth-versus-on-a-spherical-earth)).

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Eratosthenes' Experiment and Earth's Shape

This note provides a detailed exploration of whether Eratosthenes' experiment can decisively prove the Earth's round shape, evaluates the user's theoretical conjecture about a flat Earth, and identifies alternative equations and insights that could be derived from the experiment. The analysis is grounded in historical texts, mathematical derivations, and modern interpretations, ensuring a thorough examination of the topic.

#### Introduction
Eratosthenes, a Greek mathematician and geographer from around 240 BCE, is renowned for measuring the Earth's circumference with remarkable accuracy. His method involved comparing the angle of the sun's rays at two locations on the same meridian (longitude) at the same time, typically on the summer solstice. The user seeks to clarify whether there is an equation within this experiment that decisively proves the Earth's round shape, explores a theoretical thought about a flat Earth, and requests alternative equations and insights. This section addresses these queries comprehensively, considering historical context, mathematical formulations, and alternative proofs.

#### Eratosthenes' Experiment and Earth's Shape
Eratosthenes' experiment is detailed in various historical sources, including a simplified version preserved by Cleomedes, as noted in [Earth's circumference - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_circumference). He observed that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun was directly overhead in Syene, casting no shadow, while in Alexandria, a vertical stick (gnomon) cast a shadow at an angle of about 7.2 degrees. This difference in angles, combined with the known distance between the two cities (approximately 5,000 stadia), allowed him to calculate the Earth's circumference as roughly 250,000 stadia, equivalent to about 40,000 km in modern units.

The standard equation used is:
\[
C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d
\]
where:
- \(C\) is the Earth's circumference,
- \(\Delta \theta\) is the angle difference between the two locations (in degrees),
- \(d\) is the distance between the locations.

This equation assumes the Earth is a sphere, as it uses spherical geometry where the angle difference corresponds to an arc length. If the Earth were flat, there would be no "arc" or "circumference," and the formula would not hold, as discussed in [FlatEarth.ws: Eratosthenes Experiment](https://flatearth.ws/eratosthenes), which notes that flat-Earth models do not produce consistent results.

While no single equation "decisively proves" the Earth's round shape, the experiment provides strong evidence:
- The consistency of the calculated circumference (approximately 40,075 km) with modern measurements supports sphericity.
- Using multiple locations, as suggested in [Answers in Genesis: Eratosthenes Reconsidered](https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/danny-faulkner/2020/12/18/eratosthenes-reconsidered/), can further confirm this, as flat-Earth models lead to varying distances to the Sun, which is not observed.

Thus, while the equation assumes sphericity, the experiment's success and repeatability across different locations and times strongly support a round Earth.

#### Evaluation of User's Conjecture: Flat Earth and Sun Movement
The user suggests that if the Earth were a disc (flat), Eratosthenes' experiment would instead prove the movement of the sun relative to Earth. This theoretical thought requires examination.

- **Spherical Earth Context**: On a spherical Earth, the experiment assumes parallel sunrays (due to the sun's vast distance), and the angle difference \(\Delta \theta\) corresponds to the Earth's curvature. This is consistent with observations, as detailed in [Astro Navigation Demystified: Eratosthenes Proved Earth Isn’t Flat](https://astronavigationdemystified.com/eratosthenes-proved-that-the-earth-is-not-flat/), which explains how the experiment shows different shadow angles, inconsistent with a flat Earth.

- **Flat Earth Context**: On a flat Earth, if the sun were very far away, its rays would be parallel, similar to the spherical model. However, flat-Earth models often propose a close, moving sun (e.g., in a circular path above the disc). In this case:
  - The angle of the sun's rays would vary with distance from the sun, not just latitude, leading to inconsistent shadow angles at different locations.
  - At a single moment (like noon), the angles would depend on the sun's position, but the experiment would not yield a consistent "circumference," as there's no curvature to measure.
  - As noted in [Quora: Eratosthenes Experiment on Flat Earth](https://www.quora.com/Can-the-Eratosthenes-stick-experiment-work-on-a-flat-Earth), the experiment cannot work on a flat Earth, as it would not produce the observed consistent results.

- **User's Conjecture**: The idea that the experiment would prove the sun's movement is incorrect. On a flat Earth with a moving sun, the experiment would show varying and inconsistent shadow angles, not a clear measure of movement. Historical analyses, such as [Mathematics Stack Exchange: Eratosthenes on Flat vs. Spherical Earth](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3097543/eratosthenes-experiment-on-a-flat-earth-versus-on-a-spherical-earth), show that on a flat Earth, shadow lengths would be linear with distance, not following the observed non-linear pattern of a sphere.

Thus, the conjecture is **disproven**: Eratosthenes' experiment does not demonstrate the sun's movement on a flat Earth; instead, it demonstrates the Earth's curvature, as the calculations only make sense on a spherical model.

#### Alternative Proofs of Earth's Shape
Since Eratosthenes' experiment assumes sphericity, alternative methods can prove the Earth's shape:
- **Ships Disappearing Over Horizon**: As ships sail away, their hulls disappear before masts, indicating curvature, as noted in [Earth's curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_curvature).
- **Lunar Eclipses**: The Earth's shadow on the moon is always circular, consistent with a sphere, detailed in [Lunar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_eclipse).
- **Circumnavigation**: Traveling consistently in one direction and returning to the start implies a spherical surface, historically demonstrated by explorers like Magellan.

These methods confirm the Earth's shape without calculating size, complementing Eratosthenes' approach.

#### Alternative Equations and Insights
Eratosthenes' experiment can be adapted or extended to derive other insights or use alternative equations, feasible with ancient tools:

1. **Trigonometric Shadow Length Calculation**:
   - Instead of directly measuring angles, measure shadow lengths. For a gnomon of height \(h\), the shadow length \(s\) at a given location is related to the sun's altitude \(\alpha\) by:
     \[
     \tan(90^\circ - \alpha) = \frac{s}{h}
     \]
     Rearranging, the zenith angle (angle from vertical) is:
     \[
     \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{s}{h}\right)
     \]
     By comparing \(\theta\) at two locations, one can calculate the angle difference \(\Delta \theta\), used in the standard formula.

2. **Accounting for Sun's Declination**:
   - Eratosthenes' original experiment was on the summer solstice, when the sun's declination \(\delta = +23.5^\circ\). On other days, adjust for \(\delta\). The zenith angle at latitude \(\phi\) is:
     \[
     \theta = |\phi - \delta|
     \]
     For two locations, the angle difference is:
     \[
     \Delta \theta = |\phi_1 - \delta| - |\phi_2 - \delta|
     \]
     This allows the experiment on any day, not just the solstice, as discussed in [The Gnomon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomon).

3. **Multiple Locations for Accuracy**:
   - Using three or more locations, solve for the Earth's circumference by minimizing error:
     \[
     C = \frac{360^\circ}{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \Delta \theta_i} \times \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d_i
     \]
     This improves accuracy and confirms sphericity, as flat-Earth models would show inconsistencies.

4. **Calculating Earth's Axial Tilt**:
   - By performing the experiment at different times of the year, compare shadow lengths or angles to determine the Earth's axial tilt. For example:
     - Summer solstice: \(\delta = +23.5^\circ\).
     - Equinox: \(\delta = 0^\circ\).
     - This provides insights into Earth's orientation, as noted in [Eratosthenes - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes).

5. **Theoretical Flat Earth Calculation**:
   - In a flat Earth model with a close sun, one could calculate the sun's height \(H\) using:
     \[
     H = \frac{d \cdot h}{s_1 - s_2}
     \]
     where \(d\) is the distance between locations, \(h\) is the gnomon height, and \(s_1, s_2\) are shadow lengths. However, this leads to inconsistencies, as \(H\) varies widely, not observed in reality ([Answers in Genesis: Eratosthenes Reconsidered](https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/danny-faulkner/2020/12/18/eratosthenes-reconsidered/)).

This table highlights why the experiment supports a spherical Earth and disproves the flat Earth model.

#### Conclusion
Eratosthenes' experiment assumes a spherical Earth, and while no single equation "decisively proves" its shape, the consistency of results and non-linear shadow behavior strongly support sphericity. The user's conjecture that on a flat Earth, the experiment would prove sun movement is disproven, as it would show inconsistent results. Alternative proofs, like ships disappearing over the horizon and lunar eclipse shadows, confirm the Earth's shape. Alternative equations, such as trigonometric shadow calculations and adjustments for declination, offer additional insights, including Earth's axial tilt, enhancing the experiment's scope.

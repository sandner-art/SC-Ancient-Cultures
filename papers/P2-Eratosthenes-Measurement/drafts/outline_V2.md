### Final Paper Outline: Revisiting Eratosthenes’ Experiment with Modern and Ancient Approaches to Prove Earth’s Shape

#### 1. Introduction
- **Overview**: Eratosthenes’ experiment (circa 240 BCE) measured Earth’s circumference using shadow angles, offering a foundational method in astronomy and geometry.
- **Purpose**: This paper enhances the experiment with modern modifications (multiple points, nonaligned measurements, sun’s declination measurement) to measure Earth’s circumference and prove its spherical shape, while exploring the ancient method to highlight historical ingenuity.
- **Educational Value**: Designed as a hands-on activity for students, it fosters critical thinking, global collaboration, and understanding of Earth’s geometry through practical measurements and theoretical comparisons.
- **Novel Contributions**: Includes multi-point data to distinguish Earth’s shape, nonaligned point measurements for global applicability, and a rigorous analysis of flat Earth implications, with shadow curve graphs and light intensity correlations.
- **Structure**: Historical context, original and ancient methods, advanced modifications, Earth’s shape proof via shadow curves, practical experiment design, and theoretical flat Earth analysis.

#### 2. Historical and Mathematical Context
- **Historical Background**:
  - Eratosthenes, chief librarian at Alexandria, used observations from Syene and Alexandria to calculate Earth’s circumference (~40,000 km) with remarkable accuracy.
  - Ancient Greek tools: gnomon (vertical stick), bematists (surveyors), and qualitative astronomical knowledge.
  - Context: Limited timekeeping (no precise clocks) and reliance on solar observations, e.g., summer solstice when the sun was overhead at Syene.
- **Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Shadow angles relate to the sun’s zenith angle (\(\theta\)), the angle between the vertical and the sun’s rays, which reflects Earth’s curvature.
  - Key formula for circumference:
    \[
    C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d
    \]
    where \(\Delta \theta\) is the angle difference between two locations, and \(d\) is the distance (north-south for aligned points, great circle for nonaligned).
  - Sun’s declination (\(\delta\)): Varies from \(-23.5^\circ\) (winter solstice) to \(+23.5^\circ\) (summer solstice), affecting zenith angle:
    \[
    \theta = |\phi - \delta|
    \]
    where \(\phi\) is latitude.
  - Diagrams: Illustrate shadow geometry (gnomon, shadow, sun’s rays) and spherical Earth model, contrasting with flat Earth assumptions.

#### 3. The Original Experiment
- **Description**:
  - Eratosthenes measured a 7.2° shadow angle in Alexandria at noon on the summer solstice, while a well in Syene showed no shadow (sun directly overhead).
  - Distance between Syene and Alexandria: ~5,000 stadia (~787.5 km, assuming 1 stadion = 157.5 m).
  - Tools: Gnomon for shadow measurement, bematists for distance estimation.
- **Calculations**:
  - Using \(\Delta \theta = 7.2^\circ\) and \(d = 5,000\) stadia:
    \[
    C = \frac{360^\circ}{7.2^\circ} \times 5,000 = 250,000 \, \text{stadia} \approx 39,375 \, \text{km}
    \]
    (Close to modern value of ~40,075 km, ~2% error.)
  - Assumptions: Spherical Earth, parallel sun rays (valid due to sun’s distance), and aligned locations (same meridian).
- **Limitations**:
  - Relied on summer solstice for simplicity (\(\delta \approx 23.5^\circ\)).
  - Approximate distance and angle measurements introduced minor errors.

#### 4. The Ancient Method: Eratosthenes’ Approach
- **Description**:
  - Replicate Eratosthenes’ method using only ancient tools: a gnomon, manual distance measurement, and solar observations.
  - Local noon identified by shortest shadow, requiring multiple measurements around midday (e.g., every 5–10 minutes) due to lack of precise clocks.
- **Practical Challenges**:
  - **Timing**: Without clocks, pinpointing local noon is error-prone; shortest shadow approximates noon but may be off by minutes, affecting angle precision.
  - **Gnomon Length**: Longer gnomons (1–2 m) produce longer shadows, reducing relative measurement errors, especially near the zenith (e.g., Syene’s ~0° shadow).
    - Example: For a 1 m gnomon with a 0.01 m shadow, \(\theta = \arctan(0.01/1) \approx 0.57^\circ\); a 2 m gnomon doubles the shadow length, halving relative error.
  - **Distance Estimation**: Relied on bematists, less accurate than modern GPS, introducing ~5–10% error.
- **Date Dependence**:
  - Summer solstice simplified measurements (\(\delta \approx 23.5^\circ\), aligning with Syene’s latitude ~24° N).
  - General formula for any date:
    \[
    \theta = |\phi - \delta|
    \]
    Requires knowing \(\delta\), measurable via gnomon (see Section 5.3).
- **Educational Insight**:
  - Highlights ancient ingenuity and contrasts with modern tools, showing how careful observation overcame technological limits.

#### 5. Advanced Modifications
- **5.1 Multiple Measurement Points**:
  - **Rationale**: Two points suffice for circumference but risk ambiguity (flat Earth models can mimic results locally). Multiple points (3–5) provide robust evidence for sphericity.
  - **Methodology**: Collect shadow angles from diverse locations, compute pairwise \(\Delta \theta\) and distances, and verify consistent circumference.
  - **Example**: Five locations at latitudes 0°, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° N yield consistent \(C \approx 40,075 \, \text{km}\), unlike flat Earth inconsistencies.
- **5.2 Measurements at Nonaligned Points**:
  - **Concept**: Extend experiment to locations with different longitudes, using great circle distances.
  - **Methodology**:
    - Synchronize measurements at a universal time (e.g., 12:00 UTC) to ensure consistent sun position.
    - Measure shadow angles, compute zenith angles (\(\theta = \arctan(s/h)\)).
    - Calculate great circle distance using haversine formula:
      \[
      a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)
      \]
      \[
      d = R \cdot 2 \arcsin(\sqrt{a}), \quad R \approx 6,371 \, \text{km}
      \]
    - Apply:
      \[
      C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d
      \]
  - **Example**: New York (40.71° N, 74.01° W) and Lisbon (38.72° N, 9.14° W) with \(\Delta \theta = 5^\circ\), \(d \approx 5,570 \, \text{km}\), yield \(C \approx 40,104 \, \text{km}\).
  - **Global Application**: Enables collaboration across campuses (e.g., schools in Europe, Asia, Americas), enhancing educational reach.
- **5.3 Measuring Sun’s Declination**:
  - **Purpose**: Enable experiments on any date by adjusting for sun’s declination (\(\delta\)).
  - **Method Using Gnomon**:
    - At local noon (shortest shadow), measure shadow length (\(s\)) and gnomon height (\(h\)).
    - Calculate sun’s altitude (\(\alpha\)):
      \[
      \alpha = 90^\circ - \arctan\left(\frac{s}{h}\right)
      \]
    - Compute declination:
      \[
      \delta = \phi - (90^\circ - \alpha)
      \]
    - Example: At \(\phi = 40^\circ \, \text{N}\), \(h = 1 \, \text{m}\), \(s = 0.364 \, \text{m}\), \(\alpha = 90^\circ - \arctan(0.364) \approx 70^\circ\), so \(\delta = 40^\circ - 20^\circ = 20^\circ \, \text{N}\).
  - **Verification**: Compare with astronomical tables (e.g., \(\delta \approx 20^\circ\) in late May).
  - **Educational Value**: Students track \(\delta\) over time, learning about Earth’s axial tilt (23.5°) and seasonal cycles.

#### 6. Proving Earth’s Shape
- **Theoretical Models**:
  - **Spherical Earth**: Shadow length \(s = h \cdot \tan(|\phi - \delta|)\), non-linear due to tangent function, reflecting curvature.
  - **Flat Earth**: Shadow length \(s = h \cdot \frac{d}{H}\), where \(d\) is distance from subsolar point, \(H\) is sun’s height (e.g., 5,000 km), linear increase.
  - **Inverted Spheroid (Concave Earth)**: Hypothesize non-linear, potentially convergent shadows due to inward curvature, inconsistent with data.
- **Shadow Curve Predictions**:
  - **Equations**:
    - Spherical: \(s = h \cdot \tan(|\phi - \delta|)\), rapid increase near poles.
    - Flat: \(s = h \cdot \frac{\phi \cdot 40,000}{360 \cdot H}\), linear (assuming \(d \approx \frac{\phi}{360} \times 40,000 \, \text{km}\)).
    - Inverted Spheroid: Speculative, e.g., \(s \propto \cot(\phi)\), but lacks empirical support.
  - **Sample Calculations (h = 1 m, equinox, \(\delta = 0^\circ\))**:
    | Latitude (\(\phi\)) | Spherical (\(s = \tan(\phi)\)) | Flat (\(s = \frac{\phi}{45}\), H = 5,000 km) | Inverted Spheroid (Hypothetical) |
    |--------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
    | 0°                | 0 m                          | 0 m                               | ~0 m                             |
    | 30°               | 0.577 m                      | 0.667 m                           | Variable                         |
    | 60°               | 1.732 m                      | 1.333 m                           | Variable                         |
    | 80°               | 5.671 m                      | 1.778 m                           | Divergent                        |
  - **Graphs**:
    - Plot shadow length vs. latitude (0° to 90°) for each model.
    - Spherical: Steep, non-linear curve (tangent function).
    - Flat: Straight line, underestimating at high latitudes.
    - Inverted Spheroid: Hypothetical curve, likely inconsistent.
    - Include a second graph showing shadow angle (\(\theta = \arctan(s/h)\)) vs. latitude, emphasizing spherical model’s fit with real-world data.
- **Multi-Point Evidence**:
  - Multiple locations yield consistent \(C \approx 40,075 \, \text{km}\) for spherical Earth.
  - Flat Earth produces variable sun heights or circumferences, disproving model.
  - Example: Three points at 20°, 40°, 60° N show consistent \(\Delta \theta \propto \Delta \phi\), unlike flat Earth’s linear discrepancies.

#### 7. Theoretical Flat Earth Physics: Requirements and Consequences
- **Objective**: Explore what physical conditions would allow a flat Earth to produce results consistent with Eratosthenes’ experiment, and analyze their implications.
- **Requirements for Consistency**:
  - **Linear Shadow Behavior**: Shadow length must follow \(s = h \cdot \frac{d}{H}\), requiring a sun at fixed height \(H\) (e.g., 5,000 km) moving in a circular path above a flat plane.
  - **Mimicking Spherical Results**: To match observed non-linear shadow lengths (\(\tan(\phi)\)), the sun’s height or light propagation must vary systematically:
    - Variable \(H\): If \(H\) decreases with latitude (e.g., \(H \propto \cot(\phi)\)), shadows could approximate \(\tan(\phi)\), but this implies an implausible, latitude-dependent sun height.
    - Non-Parallel Rays: If light bends (e.g., via atmospheric refraction or a hypothetical medium), it could mimic curvature, but no evidence supports such bending globally.
  - **Mathematical Attempt**: For a flat Earth to yield \(C = 40,075 \, \text{km}\), the sun’s height must satisfy:
    \[
    H = \frac{d}{\tan(\Delta \theta)}
    \]
    where \(d\) is distance, \(\Delta \theta\) is observed angle difference. For multiple points, \(H\) varies (e.g., 3,000–10,000 km), contradicting a fixed sun height.
- **Physical Consequences**:
  - **Inconsistent Sun Height**: A varying \(H\) implies the sun moves vertically, unsupported by observations (e.g., consistent solar size globally).
  - **Light Bending**: Hypothetical bending requires a medium with specific refractive properties, undetected in experiments like stellar parallax.
  - **Other Physics Examples**:
    - **Gravity**: Flat Earth requires non-uniform gravity (downward everywhere), contradicting observed gravitational variations (e.g., higher at poles).
    - **Horizon**: Ships disappear hull-first, consistent with curvature, not a flat plane where all parts remain visible longer.
    - **Lunar Eclipses**: Circular shadow on the moon suggests a spherical Earth, not a flat disc’s irregular shadow.
- **Practical Consequences**:
  - **Navigation**: Flat Earth maps distort distances (e.g., southern hemisphere routes), unlike spherical models used in GPS and aviation.
  - **Day/Night Cycles**: A close sun (5,000 km) illuminates only a small area, contradicting observed global day/night patterns.
- **Light Intensity vs. Shadow Length**:
  - **Intensity Law**: Light intensity follows the inverse-square law, \(I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}\), where \(P\) is source power, \(r\) is distance. For a flat Earth sun at \(H = 5,000 \, \text{km}\), intensity decreases with distance from the subsolar point:
    \[
    I \propto \frac{1}{H^2 + d^2}
    \]
    where \(d\) is horizontal distance.
  - **Comparison with Shadows**: Shadow length \(s \propto d\), linear, while intensity drops quadratically. On a spherical Earth, shadow length \(s \propto \tan(\phi)\), and intensity remains nearly constant (sun’s distance ~150 million km, negligible variation). Observed solar intensity is uniform globally, supporting spherical model.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: No direct physics correlation between shadow length and intensity, as shadows depend on angle (geometry), while intensity depends on distance (radiative transfer). Flat Earth’s linear shadows predict inconsistent intensity drops, unobserved in reality.
- **Conclusion**: Flat Earth requires implausible physics (variable sun height, light bending) to mimic Eratosthenes’ results, with consequences contradicting navigation, gravity, and intensity observations. Spherical model aligns with all evidence.

#### 8. Practical Experiment Design for Students
- **Overview**: Provide two experimental protocols: (1) Modern method with synchronized clocks and nonaligned points, (2) Ancient method mimicking Eratosthenes’ approach.
- **Modern Method**:
  - **Setup**:
    - Place a gnomon (1 m recommended) on a flat, level surface.
    - Record approximate latitude/longitude (from maps or local data).
  - **Procedure**:
    - Coordinate with 3–5 global locations (e.g., school campuses in different continents).
    - At a synchronized UTC time (e.g., 12:00 UTC), measure shadow length (\(s\)) and gnomon height (\(h\)).
    - Calculate zenith angle: \(\theta = \arctan(s/h)\).
    - Compute great circle distances using haversine formula (or approximate via online tools for simplicity).
    - Calculate circumference: \(C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d\).
    - Optionally, measure at local noon to compute \(\delta = \phi - (90^\circ - \alpha)\).
  - **Materials**: Gnomon, measuring tape, protractor or smartphone app, clock/app for UTC synchronization.
- **Ancient Method**:
  - **Setup**: Use a taller gnomon (1–2 m) for precision, placed vertically.
  - **Procedure**:
    - Take shadow measurements every 5–10 minutes around midday to find shortest shadow (local noon).
    - Measure \(s\) and \(h\) at local noon, compute \(\theta = \arctan(s/h)\).
    - Use two aligned locations (north-south, if feasible) or estimate distance manually (e.g., via travel routes).
    - Adjust for \(\delta\) using measured or tabulated values.
    - Calculate circumference as above.
  - **Challenges**: Timing errors without clocks, manual distance estimation, and gnomon alignment.
- **Accuracy Tips**:
  - Average multiple measurements to reduce errors.
  - Ensure vertical gnomon and level surface.
  - Verify results with peers globally.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Template: Record location, time, \(s\), \(h\), \(\theta\), distance, and computed \(C\).
  - Plot shadow angle vs. latitude, compare with spherical, flat, and inverted spheroid predictions.
  - Analyze consistency of \(C\) across multiple points to prove sphericity.

#### 9. Conclusion
- **Summary**: The paper reimagines Eratosthenes’ experiment with modern modifications (multiple points, nonaligned measurements, declination measurement) and an ancient approach, proving Earth’s spherical shape through consistent circumference calculations and shadow curves.
- **Educational Impact**: Fosters global collaboration, hands-on learning, and critical analysis of Earth’s geometry, contrasting ancient and modern methods.
- **Theoretical Insight**: Flat Earth models require implausible physics, while spherical models align with observations, reinforced by light intensity analysis.
- **Future Directions**: Explore seasonal variations, develop digital platforms for real-time data sharing, or extend to other astronomical measurements (e.g., axial tilt, stellar parallax).

1. Introduction
In approximately 240 BCE, Eratosthenes of Cyrene measured Earth’s circumference with remarkable accuracy using a simple yet ingenious method involving shadow angles and geometry [1]. By observing the sun’s position at two locations—Syene (modern Aswan) and Alexandria—he calculated a circumference close to the modern value of 40,075 km [2]. This experiment remains a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, blending observation, mathematics, and astronomy.
This paper enhances Eratosthenes’ method with modern modifications to measure Earth’s circumference and prove its spherical shape, addressing educational and scientific goals. Key innovations include:

Using multiple measurement points to strengthen evidence for sphericity.
Allowing measurements at nonaligned locations (differing in longitude) via spherical trigonometry.
Measuring the sun’s declination with a gnomon to enable experiments year-round.
Predicting shadow curves for spherical, flat, and inverted spheroid Earth models.
Analyzing the physical requirements for a flat Earth to mimic observed results, including light intensity correlations.

We present dual experiment designs: a modern version leveraging synchronized clocks and global collaboration, and an ancient version replicating Eratosthenes’ clockless, gnomon-based approach. These designs target students, fostering hands-on learning and critical analysis of Earth’s geometry. The paper explores the theoretical and practical implications of flat Earth physics, providing a rigorous comparison with observed data.
2. Historical and Mathematical Context
2.1 Historical Background
Eratosthenes, chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria, was a polymath whose contributions spanned mathematics, geography, and astronomy [1]. His experiment capitalized on the observation that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun was directly overhead in Syene, casting no shadow, while in Alexandria, a gnomon cast a shadow at a 7.2° angle [2]. Using the known distance between the cities (~5,000 stadia, approximately 787.5 km), he calculated Earth’s circumference.
Ancient Greeks lacked precise clocks, relying on solar observations and tools like the gnomon—a vertical stick used to measure shadow angles [3]. Distance measurements were estimated by bematists, professional surveyors who counted steps, introducing minor errors [4]. The experiment’s success highlights the ingenuity of ancient science, constrained by limited technology.
2.2 Mathematical Foundations
The experiment hinges on the relationship between shadow angles and Earth’s curvature. The sun’s zenith angle ((\theta)), the angle between the vertical and the sun’s rays, varies with latitude ((\phi)) and the sun’s declination ((\delta)), the angle between the sun’s rays and the equatorial plane [5]. At local noon:[\theta = |\phi - \delta|]On the summer solstice, (\delta \approx 23.5^\circ), simplifying measurements at Syene ((\phi \approx 24^\circ)).
Shadow length ((s)) for a gnomon of height ((h)) is:[s = h \cdot \tan(\theta)]The circumference ((C)) is calculated using the angle difference ((\Delta \theta)) between two locations and their distance ((d)):[C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d]For nonaligned points, (d) is the great circle distance, computed via spherical trigonometry (Section 5.2). Figure 1 (not shown) illustrates shadow geometry on a spherical Earth, contrasting with flat Earth assumptions.
3. The Original Experiment
Eratosthenes observed that at noon on the summer solstice, a well in Syene cast no shadow, indicating a zenith angle of 0°, while a gnomon in Alexandria cast a shadow corresponding to (\theta = 7.2^\circ) [2]. The distance between the cities was estimated at 5,000 stadia (~787.5 km, assuming 1 stadion = 157.5 m) [4].
Using:[C = \frac{360^\circ}{7.2^\circ} \times 5,000 = 250,000 , \text{stadia} \approx 39,375 , \text{km}]This result is within ~2% of the modern value (40,075 km), remarkable given ancient tools [2]. Assumptions included a spherical Earth, parallel sun rays (valid due to the sun’s distance of ~150 million km), and aligned locations (same meridian). Limitations included reliance on the solstice and approximate measurements.
4. The Ancient Method: Eratosthenes’ Approach
4.1 Description
To replicate Eratosthenes’ method, students use a gnomon and manual observations without modern clocks. At local noon, identified by the shortest shadow, the shadow length ((s)) and gnomon height ((h)) are measured to compute the zenith angle:[\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{s}{h}\right)]Two aligned locations (north-south) are preferred, with distance estimated manually (e.g., via travel routes).
4.2 Practical Challenges

Timing: Without clocks, local noon is approximated by taking multiple shadow measurements around midday (every 5–10 minutes) and selecting the shortest shadow [3]. This introduces timing errors of ~1–2 minutes, affecting angle precision by ~0.03°–0.05°.
Gnomon Length: A longer gnomon (1–2 m) produces a longer shadow, reducing relative measurement errors, especially near the zenith. For a 1 m gnomon with (s = 0.01 , \text{m}), (\theta \approx 0.57^\circ); a 2 m gnomon doubles the shadow, halving relative error [6].
Distance Estimation: Manual methods (e.g., pacing) are less accurate than GPS, introducing ~5–10% error [4].

4.3 Date Dependence
Eratosthenes used the summer solstice ((\delta \approx 23.5^\circ)), aligning with Syene’s latitude, so (\theta \approx 0^\circ). For other dates, adjust using:[\theta = |\phi - \delta|]Students can measure (\delta) (Section 5.3), enabling year-round experiments. This highlights the experiment’s flexibility and ancient observational challenges.
5. Advanced Modifications
5.1 Multiple Measurement Points
Using more than two locations strengthens evidence for Earth’s sphericity by reducing ambiguity [7]. Flat Earth models can mimic two-point results locally but fail across multiple points due to inconsistent shadow angles. For example, five locations at latitudes 0°, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80° N yield consistent (C \approx 40,075 , \text{km}), computed pairwise using:[C = \frac{360^\circ}{\Delta \theta} \times d]This approach confirms spherical geometry through data consistency.
5.2 Measurements at Nonaligned Points
Nonaligned points (differing in longitude) require synchronized measurements at a universal time (e.g., 12:00 UTC) to ensure consistent sun position [8]. Shadow angles are measured, and zenith angles computed:[\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{s}{h}\right)]Great circle distance ((d)) is calculated using the haversine formula:[a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\phi_2 - \phi_1}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1) \cos(\phi_2) \sin^2\left(\frac{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1}{2}\right)][d = R \cdot 2 \arcsin(\sqrt{a}), \quad R \approx 6,371 , \text{km}]Example: New York (40.71° N, 74.01° W) and Lisbon (38.72° N, 9.14° W) with (\Delta \theta = 5^\circ), (d \approx 5,570 , \text{km}), yield:[C = \frac{360^\circ}{5^\circ} \times 5,570 \approx 40,104 , \text{km}]This modification enables global collaboration across campuses, enhancing educational reach.
5.3 Measuring Sun’s Declination
To conduct experiments on any date, students measure the sun’s declination ((\delta)) using a gnomon:

At local noon (shortest shadow), measure (s) and (h).
Calculate sun’s altitude ((\alpha)):[\alpha = 90^\circ - \arctan\left(\frac{s}{h}\right)]
Compute declination:[\delta = \phi - (90^\circ - \alpha)]Example: At (\phi = 40^\circ , \text{N}), (h = 1 , \text{m}), (s = 0.364 , \text{m}), (\alpha \approx 70^\circ), so:[\delta = 40^\circ - (90^\circ - 70^\circ) = 20^\circ , \text{N}]This matches late May or July values [5]. Tracking (\delta) over time teaches students about Earth’s axial tilt (23.5°) and seasonal cycles.

6. Proving Earth’s Shape
6.1 Theoretical Models

Spherical Earth: Shadow length follows:[s = h \cdot \tan(|\phi - \delta|)]Non-linear due to the tangent function, reflecting curvature [9].
Flat Earth: Shadow length:[s = h \cdot \frac{d}{H}]where (d) is distance from the subsolar point, (H) is sun’s height (e.g., 5,000 km), linear increase [10].
Inverted Spheroid: Hypothesize non-linear, potentially convergent shadows due to inward curvature, unsupported by data.

6.2 Shadow Curve Predictions
Table 1 shows shadow lengths for (h = 1 , \text{m}), equinox ((\delta = 0^\circ)):

6.3 Multi-Point Evidence
Multiple locations (e.g., 20°, 40°, 60° N) yield consistent (C \approx 40,075 , \text{km}), while flat Earth models produce variable sun heights (3,000–10,000 km) or circumferences, disproving alternatives [7]. This robust dataset confirms sphericity.
7. Theoretical Flat Earth Physics: Requirements and Consequences
7.1 Requirements for Consistency
To mimic Eratosthenes’ results on a flat Earth, shadow lengths must approximate the spherical model’s non-linear behavior. The flat Earth formula:[s = h \cdot \frac{d}{H}]is linear, where (d \approx \frac{\phi}{360} \times 40,000 , \text{km}). To match (s = h \cdot \tan(\phi)):

Variable Sun Height: (H) must vary with latitude, e.g., (H \propto \cot(\phi)), but this implies a sun moving vertically (3,000–10,000 km), contradicting consistent solar size globally [10].
Light Bending: Hypothetical atmospheric refraction could bend rays to mimic curvature, but no medium exhibits such properties globally, and stellar parallax remains unaffected [11].

Calculate sun height:[H = \frac{d}{\tan(\Delta \theta)}]For multiple points, (H) varies, indicating inconsistency.
7.2 Physical Consequences

Gravity: Flat Earth requires non-uniform gravity (downward everywhere), contradicting observed variations (higher at poles) [12].
Horizon: Ships disappear hull-first, consistent with curvature, not a flat plane [13].
Lunar Eclipses: Earth’s circular shadow on the moon suggests a sphere, not a disc’s irregular shadow [14].
Navigation: Flat Earth maps distort southern hemisphere distances, unlike spherical models used in GPS [15].

7.3 Light Intensity vs. Shadow Length
Light intensity follows the inverse-square law:[I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}]For a flat Earth sun at (H = 5,000 , \text{km}):[I \propto \frac{1}{H^2 + d^2}]Intensity drops quadratically with distance (d), while shadow length is linear ((s \propto d)). On a spherical Earth, the sun’s distance (~150 million km) ensures near-constant intensity, and shadow length follows (\tan(\phi)). Observed uniform solar intensity supports the spherical model [16]. No direct physics correlation exists between shadow length (geometric) and intensity (radiative), as they depend on different principles.
7.4 Conclusion
Flat Earth requires implausible physics (variable sun height, light bending), contradicting gravity, navigation, and intensity observations. The spherical model aligns with all evidence.
